# 🔒 SECURITY CHECKLIST - READ BEFORE UPLOADING TO GITHUB!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: YOUR CREDENTIALS ARE CURRENTLY EXPOSED!

### 🚨 EXPOSED CREDENTIALS FOUND:
- **Supabase Database**: URL and API keys in `server/.env`
- **Gmail Account**: Email and app password in `server/.env`
- **JWT Secret**: Authentication key in `server/.env`

## 🔧 REQUIRED ACTIONS BEFORE GITHUB UPLOAD:

### 1. 🔴 CHANGE ALL CREDENTIALS IMMEDIATELY:

#### Supabase (Database):
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api
2. Reset/regenerate ALL API keys
3. Update your local `.env` file with new keys

#### Gmail (Email Service):
1. Go to Google Account Security
2. Revoke the current app password: `yyuo agah srdd fjhz`
3. Generate a new app-specific password
4. Update your local `.env` file

#### JWT Secret:
1. Generate a new secure secret (32+ characters)
2. Update your local `.env` file

### 2. ✅ VERIFY .gitignore PROTECTION:
The following files are now protected in `.gitignore`:
```
.env
server/.env
server/.env.local
server/.env.development.local
server/.env.test.local
server/.env.production.local
```

### 3. 🔍 FINAL VERIFICATION STEPS:

Before running `git add .`:

1. Initialize git repo:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Check what will be committed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git status
   ```

3. **VERIFY `.env` files are NOT listed!**

4. If `.env` appears in git status:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD server/.env
   echo "server/.env" >> .gitignore
   ```

### 4. 📋 SAFE FILES TO COMMIT:
✅ Source code files (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.css`)
✅ Configuration files (`package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`)
✅ Documentation files (`.md`)
✅ `.env.example` (template file - SAFE)
✅ `.gitignore`

❌ **NEVER COMMIT:**
- `.env` files
- `node_modules/`
- Any file with passwords/keys
- Database dumps with real data

### 5. 🌐 DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
When deploying to production:
- Use environment variables in your hosting platform
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use different credentials for production vs development

## ✅ CHECKLIST COMPLETE:
- [ ] Changed Supabase API keys
- [ ] Changed Gmail app password
- [ ] Generated new JWT secret
- [ ] Verified `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Tested `git status` shows no `.env` files
- [ ] Ready to push to GitHub safely

## 🆘 IF CREDENTIALS WERE ALREADY COMMITTED:
If you've already pushed credentials to GitHub:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** change all exposed credentials
2. Consider the repository compromised
3. You may need to delete and recreate the repository
4. Use `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive data from history

**Remember**: Security is not optional! Always verify before pushing to public repositories.
